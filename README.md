Developed a 12-month financial model for NutriNibbles, a Bangalore-based biscuit company, to evaluate the launch of a new ragi-based health biscuit. The project focused on sales forecasting, raw material costing, variable and fixed costs, and identifying the break-even point under dynamic market assumptions.
